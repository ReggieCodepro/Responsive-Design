            <h2>First Time overseas "Australia!"</h2>
            <p>Our first trip to AUSTRALIA did not disappoint! Our Itinarary was perfect for us Alaskan adventurers! A well rounded trip from Sydney to Cairns and so much in between. We hiked in the Blue Mountains and swam at Lake Eacham walked amongst the kangaroo s and Cockatoo s and held the precious Koala bears. We romped in the rain forest and stayed at Rose Gums enjoyed the 3 bedroom treehouse with all the creature comforts! On to Port Douglas and the Great Barrier Reef a life long memory to say the least . Fishing was a treat for the guys as they brought home dinner with a Coral Trout and a Giant Trevally yummy! Finished our trip with relaxing at the pools or a walk on the beach . Enjoyed shopping and trying the different restaurants and cafes even tryed kangaroo , yes please! Finished our journey in Cairns at the Mantre Espalade resort we enjoyed winding down here and soaking up some sunshine and more swimming! We were very active and will say we embraced the Aussie spirit to the fullest Its hard to pick a favorite thing, I think just experiencing the lovely country side in very warm temps, driving our rental car first time on the left and coming out of a cold Alaskan winter . The places we stayed were just right for our group of 5 and About Australia met our needs perfectly . We highly recommend them to make your dream trip come true . Thank you Mates!!</p>
            
            <p>Melbourne: accommodations were clean and well-located, and the desk staff gave helpful recommendations - it's a walking and foodie city (excellent tour by Monique) - great tour to the animal farm and little blue penguins
                Uluru: beautiful accommodations - good dining options - sunrise and sunset tours to Uluru and Kata Juta were amazing - again, informative guides
                Cairns: (would have liked an extra day here to enjoy the beach-y city) good accommodations - exciting trip to the Great Barrier Reef (lots of options to see the coral and fish, but the snorkeling was the best we've ever experience
                Sydney: lively and livable city (noise from street work sign of renewing city transportation) - fun to stay in Chinatown - hop-on-hop-off tour was excellent way to tour the whole harbor - we did Tour & Tasting Plate to see the Opera House which was perfect (go later in the day so you can experience the beauty of the Bay at dark)
